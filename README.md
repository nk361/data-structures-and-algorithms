# data-structures-and-algorithms
This project is purely for learning and possible future use. If you'd like me to attempt to make a data structure or algorithm that isn't present, you can open it as an issue. If you'd like to contribute, you can add new structures or algorithms or remake finished ones in another language.
I'm using google test to test my headers
